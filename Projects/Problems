# Installing PyDictionary
PyDictionary depends on goslate which is dependant on futures, since futures is not supported by Python 3 it causes error. One way of preventing this is to install goslate directly from the GitHub Repository.

First install goslate from GitHub Repository:
pip install -e git+https://github.com/yeahwhat-mc/goslate#egg=goslate

Then install PyDictionary:
pip install PyDictionary
